# Time Series Concepts

This repository is mainly focused on providing *time series* examples, concepts and general
analysis of them in the [Python programming language](https://www.python.org/).

All documents are writen in Python Markdown markup language and converted to HTML files
using [`Pweave`](https://github.com/mpastell/Pweave).

These documents are ports of the originals written in the [R programming language](https://github.com/BioLogs/TimeSeriesConcepts.r)
and the one written in the [Julia programming language](https://github.com/BioLogs/TimeSeriesConcepts.jl).
